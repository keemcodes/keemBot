# keemBot IRC powered Twitch bot
I coded this bot in mSL which is a small scripting language for mIRC.

# Why did I make this?
I used to code alot of mSL fun bots in my youth because I spent alot of time on a SA:MP Server called GamerX. I'd spent a ton of time in their internet relay chat talking to my friends.
Back then... IRC was basically like discord. Everyone had IRC and that was the main way to chat with your game buddies outside of the game. We're talking 2007-2011... IRC is much older than that though

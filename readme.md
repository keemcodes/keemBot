# keemBot IRC powered Twitch bot
I coded this bot in mSL which is a small scripting language for mIRC. This was made in 2018
This is a dice rolling style chat bot which allows users to create accounts and track their score in a number of chat games.
This bot also allowed twitch chat viewers to challenge the streamer. It would also track how many challenges users posed to the streamer and a ton of other details

# Why did I make this?
I used to code alot of mSL fun bots in my youth because I spent alot of time on a SA:MP Server called GamerX. I'd spent a ton of time in their internet relay chat talking to my friends.
Back then... IRC was basically like discord. Everyone had IRC and that was the main way to chat with your game buddies outside of the game. We're talking 2007-2011... IRC is much older than that though
#### long story short... nostalgia. 
I learned quite a bit of coding messing around with mIRC back in 08-09. I wanted to get a feel for the language again
